# Data-driven HCE analysis based on tree models
Don't stress. We are going to start from scratch.


## Causal Inference with binary treatment

- SUTVA

## Counterfactuals and the treatment effect

## Estimation Strategies

1. Unconditional Unconfoundedness(e.g. RCT)
2. Unconfoundedness
3. Existence of an IV

## Heterogeneous Treatment Effects


## Machine Learning
ML started with a simple problem:

The unbiased predictor is not usually the minimum-error predictor.
But most models are based on unbiasedness!

- Penalization
- Cross-Validation

ML performs great in selecting adequate models.
$\rightarrow$ can maybe help us set up hypothesis!


## Tree-based models: adaptive vs honest
